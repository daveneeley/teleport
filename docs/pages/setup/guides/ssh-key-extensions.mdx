title: Using Teleport CA with Github.
description:  How to use Teleport SSH short lived certificates with the GitHubs Certificate Authority.
---

Teleport supports exporting user SSH certificates with configurable key extensions, this allows the Teleport CA to be used in conjunction with GitHubs support for SSH Certificate Authorities to allow users to access their organizations repositories with short lived, signed SSH keys.

## Prerequisites

- Teleport v(=teleport.version=) Open Source or Enterprise.
- Telport with [GitHub SSO configured](../admin/github-ssh.mdx).
- Access to GitHub enterprise and permisions to modify GitHub SSH Certificate authorities.

## Step 1/3. Import the Teleport CA into GitHub

In order to export the Teleport CA, execute the following command:

```code
$ tctl auth export > teleport.ca
```

Next follow the instructions in the guide below to import your Teleport CA into GitHUB

[Managing your organization's SSH certificate authorities](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-git-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-your-organizations-ssh-certificate-authorities)

The contents of the exported `teleport.ca` file should by pasted into the "Key" field after clicking "New CA".

## Step 2/3. Configure the GitHub key extension

Create or update a role to include the `cert_extensions` option, in order to interact with the support GitHub has for  SSH CAs, the name value here must be `login@github.com`.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: developer
spec:
  options:
     cert_extensions:
       - type: ssh
         mode: extension
         name: login@github.com
         value: "{{ external.logins }}"
```

## Step 3/3. Issue a user certificate

A user certificate may be issued with the following command, where `<USERNAME>` is the Teleport user to generate the ssh certificate for:
```code
$ tctl auth sign --out out.cer --user=<USERNAME>
```

This newly generated certificate may then be used when interacting with GitHub over SSH by adding the following to the `~/.ssh/config` file

```code
Host github.com
 HostName github.com
 IdentityFile out.cer
```
